Robustness is a key feature of biological systems that maintain its functions against internal and external disturbance, through interactions between components. (Kitano, 2004). Robustness could involve either reverting the system back to its original state or transiting into new state as long as its function is maintained. As biological organisms are continuously challenged with internal and external environment changes, robustness is pervasive and essential in biological system, such as bacterial chemotaxis, protein folding and gene expression. This facilitate evolution through selection of traits that are allow robustness towards environmental perturbation.   

Yet despite these robust adaptations, it is almost impossible for biological systems to be adapted to all disturbances, especially rare or unseen challenges. In order to acquire robustness against certain challenges, trade-off is unavoidable due to increased demand of resources, reduced performance or in the form of fragility to other perturbations.  

Gene redundancy and phenotypic plasticity is one of the many mechanisms of robustness. It serve as ‘back-up’ mechanism mechanism towards loss of function, which multiple copies of gene that perform the same function are present, such that when one of the copy is inactivated upon accumulated mutations, the extra copies could serve as replacement (Nowak, 1997). Such tolerance on gene duplication event is rare in rapidly dividing organisms such as virus and bacteria, as having redundant copy of genes leads to larger genome size and higher demand of energy resources. Gene redundancy is said to be the key of survival for biological organisms of small populations as it maintains the phenotypic stability under changing environments, ensuring all individuals having higher fitness for survival.  

A second example of robustness is the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), which is capable of hijacking human’s immune system for its own replication and infection. High mutation rate allows the virus to effectively evade host cells defense mechanism, posing a great challenge on HIV infection diagnosis and treatment. Interestingly, such high selective pressure salso result in the trade-off of extreme genetic fragility of viral proteins, particularly the capsid (CA) domain of HIV-1 Gag protein. It is indispensable in viral particle assembly, transferring viral genetic materials into host cells and many other processes throughout the virus life cycle (Freed, 1998). Since the integrity of capsid protein is the key to virus replication, it is highly conserved and hypersensitive to genetic variations. As shown by Rihn etl al. (2013), 70% of randomly introduced mutagenesis rendered the virus to be non-viable. As such, capsid protein has become an attractive target for development of antiretroviral agents 

The concept of biological robustness and fragility is explained by Highly optimized tolerance (HOT) theory proposed by Carlson & Doyle (1999). When a system is highly adapted to handle specific perturbations, it is unavoidably susceptible to unanticipated disturbance.  Hence, fragility can be reduced if the handling mechanism is more flexible and dynamic. One example of anti-fragility against the hypersensitivity of HIV viral proteins as mentioned above, is to produce proteins of larger size and more flexible. Protein of larger size could have more residues interacting with substrates, hence less sensitive to loss of function mutation of one single residue (Danchin et. al., 2011).
